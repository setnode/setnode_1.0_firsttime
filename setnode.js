// Understanding Blockchain Nodes in Node.js Format

/**
 * A blockchain node is an essential component of any blockchain network.
 * Nodes are distributed devices or entities that work together to maintain and secure the blockchain.
 * Each node has a unique role, but collectively, they ensure the decentralized and trustless nature of blockchain technology.
 */

// Types of Blockchain Nodes
const blockchainNodes = {
    fullNode: {
        description: "Full nodes store the entire blockchain ledger and validate all transactions and blocks independently.",
        examples: ["Bitcoin Core"],
        role: "Ensure the network's security and integrity."
    },
    lightNode: {
        description: "Lightweight nodes do not store the entire blockchain but rely on full nodes to retrieve information.",
        useCase: "Commonly used in mobile wallets for efficiency."
    },
    miningNode: {
        description: "Mining nodes validate transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles to create new blocks.",
        importance: "Crucial in proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms."
    },
    masternode: {
        description: "Masternodes perform specialized tasks like transaction validation, governance, or enabling features such as instant transactions.",
        association: "Often linked to proof-of-stake (PoS) or similar consensus mechanisms."
    }

// Functions of Blockchain Nodes
function getNodeFunctions() {
    return [
        "Transaction Validation: Nodes validate and propagate transactions across the network.",
        "Decentralization: Nodes ensure that no single entity controls the blockchain by distributing the ledger across multiple participants.",
        "Consensus Participation: Nodes play a role in achieving agreement on the state of the blockchain through consensus algorithms.",
        "Data Storage: Full nodes maintain a complete copy of the blockchain ledger."
    ];

// Setting Up a Blockchain Node
const setupNode = (blockchainProtocol) => {
    const hardwareRequirements = {
        Bitcoin: {
            storage: "500 GB",
            ram: "2 GB",
            internet: "High-speed connection"
        },
        Ethereum: {
            storage: "1 TB",
            ram: "4 GB",
            internet: "Stable connection"
        }
    };

    return {
        step1: `Choose the blockchain protocol: ${blockchainProtocol}`,
        step2: `Meet hardware requirements: ${JSON.stringify(hardwareRequirements[blockchainProtocol] || "Custom requirements").replace(/,/g, ', ')}`,
        step3: "Download official node software (e.g., Bitcoin Core or Geth).",
        step4: "Synchronize with the network to download blockchain history.",
        step5: "Maintain your node by ensuring uptime and updating software regularly."

// Benefits of Running a Blockchain Node
const benefitsOfRunningNode = [
    "Enhanced Privacy: No reliance on third parties to verify transactions.",
    "Network Security: Contributing to decentralization helps secure the network.",
    "Participation in Governance: Some projects reward node operators with voting rights or financial incentives."

// Challenges of Running a Node
const challengesOfNode = [
    "Resource Intensive: Full nodes require substantial storage and bandwidth.",
    "Technical Complexity: Setting up and maintaining a node demands technical knowledge.",
    "Costs: Power consumption and hardware maintenance can be expensive."
